Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the optimal hyperplane that best separates the data points into different classes while maximizing the margin between the classes. 

In classification tasks, SVM aims to find a decision boundary (hyperplane) that best separates the data points of different classes with the largest possible margin. This hyperplane is selected such that it maximizes the distance between the nearest data points of each class, known as support vectors.

SVM can handle both linear and nonlinear classification tasks through the use of different kernel functions, such as linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid kernels. These kernels enable SVM to map the input data into a higher-dimensional feature space where the classes become linearly separable.

Key advantages of SVM include its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces, robustness against overfitting (especially in cases with high-dimensional feature spaces), and versatility in handling both linear and nonlinear classification tasks.

SVM is widely used in various fields such as text classification, image recognition, bioinformatics, and finance due to its ability to handle complex datasets and produce accurate classification results. However, it can be computationally intensive, especially with large datasets, and the selection of the appropriate kernel and hyperparameters can require careful tuning.
